## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Fixing "23 Open Sessions" / Blank Screen

### The Problem

If you're seeing:
- ❌ Blank screen on your Streamlit app
- ❌ "23 open sessions" error
- ❌ Old data showing instead of new data
- ❌ App not updating after pushing changes

**This means:** Your Streamlit Cloud deployment is pointing to the **wrong repository** or has **multiple stale instances** running.

### The Solution (3 Steps)

#### Step 1: Delete ALL Old Streamlit Deployments

1. Go to: https://share.streamlit.io/manage
2. Look for ANY app related to "CEC-WAM", "PSI", "HOT-CORE", etc.
3. Click the "⋮" menu on each → "Delete"
4. Delete ALL old instances (this clears the 23 sessions)

#### Step 2: Clear GitHub Actions Queue

1. Go to: https://github.com/whiteantwan58-tech/CEC-WAM-HOT-CORE/actions
2. Click on any "In Progress" or "Queued" workflows
3. Click "Cancel workflow" for each one
4. This stops the session jam

#### Step 3: Deploy Fresh Instance

1. Go to: https://share.streamlit.io
2. Click "New app"
3. **USE THESE EXACT SETTINGS:**
   ```
   Repository: whiteantwan58-tech/CEC-WAM-HOT-CORE
   Branch: main
   Main file path: streamlit_app.py
   ```
4. Click "Deploy!"
5. Wait 2-5 minutes for build

#### Step 4: Verify Live Data

Once deployed, check these metrics are showing:

| Metric | Expected Value |
|--------|----------------|
| 💎 PSI Peg | $0.003466 |
| 📊 System Mass | 100,001.33 |
| 📈 Area Rate | 14.29% |
| 🟢 Status | SYNCHRONIZED |

If data looks wrong:
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Enable "🔒 Use Frozen/Locked Data" checkbox in the app

### Use **GitHub Pages / Vercel** if:
- ✅ You want the fastest loading times
- ✅ You prefer pure HTML/CSS/JS (no Python)
- ✅ You need guaranteed 24/7 uptime
- ✅ You want to serve from custom domain

**Recommendation:** Use **Streamlit Cloud** for the full interactive experience!

## 🧪 5D Interface Live Check (All Repositories)

If your mobile deploy flow shows multiple repos and you need to verify which one is truly live, run:

```bash
# Optional but recommended for higher GitHub API rate limits
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here

python3 tools/repo_interface_audit.py --owner whiteantwan58-tech
```

What this checks for each repository:
- write/admin vs read-only permission (helps identify deploy-key lockouts)
- Streamlit entry point (`streamlit_app.py` or `app.py`)
- static interface entry point (`index.html` or `dashboard.html`)
- GitHub Pages status
- archived state

A JSON report is saved to:

```text
reports/repo_interface_audit.json
```

Use this to quickly confirm `CEC-WAM-HOT-CORE` is the active repo for the 5D interface deployment.
