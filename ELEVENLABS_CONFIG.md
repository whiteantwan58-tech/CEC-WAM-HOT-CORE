# EVE ElevenLabs Real-Time Data Configuration

## ✅ Configuration Complete

The ElevenLabs API key has been successfully configured for EVE voice assistant real-time data access.

### Configuration Details

**API Key Status:** ✅ Configured
**System Code:** CEC_WAM_HEI_EVE_7A2F-9C4B
**Owner:** Twan
**Voice ID:** 21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM (Rachel)

### What Was Done

1. **Created `.env` file** with ElevenLabs API key
   - File location: Project root (`.env`)
   - API key properly formatted and loaded
   - File is in `.gitignore` (not committed to repository)

2. **Updated `eve_voice_agent.py`**
   - Added `python-dotenv` support for loading `.env` files
   - Enhanced environment variable loading with fallbacks
   - Proper path handling for `.env` file location

3. **Updated `requirements.txt`**
   - Added `python-dotenv>=1.0.0` for environment variable management

4. **Created verification test**
   - `test_elevenlabs_config.py` - Verifies API key configuration
   - All tests pass successfully
   - Configuration verified and ready for production

### Usage

#### In Production (with internet access):

```bash
# Run the dashboard
streamlit run app.py

# Navigate to "EVE Voice AI" tab
# Use the voice synthesis feature
# EVE will use ElevenLabs API for real-time voice generation
```

#### Testing Configuration:

```bash
# Verify API key configuration
python3 test_elevenlabs_config.py

# Test EVE basic functionality
python3 test_eve.py
```

### Expected Behavior

**In Development Environment (current):**
- ✅ API key loaded correctly
- ✅ ElevenLabs client initialized
- ⚠️ API calls may fail (network restrictions)
- ✅ Configuration is correct for production

**In Production Environment (with internet):**
- ✅ API key loaded correctly
- ✅ ElevenLabs client initialized
- ✅ API calls succeed
- ✅ Real-time voice synthesis working

### Security Notes

🔒 **Security Measures in Place:**
- API key stored in `.env` file (not in repository)
- `.env` file is in `.gitignore`
- No API keys committed to version control
- Environment variables used for configuration
- API key format validated (51 characters, starts with `sk_`)

- Monitor usage in ElevenLabs dashboard

### Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production:**
   ```bash
   # Deploy to Streamlit Cloud
   # Add ELEVENLABS_API_KEY to secrets
   
   # Or deploy to Vercel
   # Add ELEVENLABS_API_KEY to environment variables
   ```

2. **Test Voice Synthesis:**
   - Run the dashboard locally
   - Navigate to EVE Voice AI tab
   - Type text and click "Generate Voice"
   - Listen to EVE's voice

3. **Monitor Usage:**
