CEC-WAM-HOT-CORE Streamlit App Entry Point

This is the main entry point for Streamlit Cloud deployment.
Streamlit Cloud expects a file named 'streamlit_app.py' by default.

IMPORTANT: Ensure your Streamlit Cloud deployment points to this repository:
https://github.com/whiteantwan58-tech/CEC-WAM-HOT-CORE

For deployment instructions, see STREAMLIT_DEPLOYMENT.md
